        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            This project was inspired originally by Kenny Chenâ€™s original black hole project from sp20. We originally wanted to do a full on expansion of that project, but after learning about the flexibility of particle simulation (after looking at the game Noita) we figured we could do something more general by recreating scenes using a set of predefined particles that simplify the simulation. We wish to animate interesting scenes and have a random element added to our particles that make them more lively. Depending on the textures given, we should be able to create and animate scenes based on how our particles interact realistically with light, with each other, and with other particles. 
        </p>
        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        
        <p>
            The purpose of this project is to use particle simulation to make animated, interesting, 2-dimensional scenes.  This is not an interactive demo, rather a scene with predefined initial conditionals that we render for 10 seconds.   
        </p>
        
        
        
        

        <h3>Work Plan (Updated)</h3>
        
            <p>
                Week 1 + 2: Research paper readings on particle sim, finding an adequate framework to work in and how to render these scenes. Stuff like THREE.js comes to mind (from Kenny), but there could be better packages using more familiar languages, like python of c++. We need to do the bulk of our project structure in this and the second week. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Week 3: Putting together structures, adequate textures, and generating a simulation using our particles on an 8 bit example animation. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Week 4: Rendering more complex and granular animations, like the galaxy sim. 
        </p>
        <br>
