        <h1>Overall Goal:Simulated many types of particles in 2D Space</h1>
        <p>
            Given an image, be able to represent that image with a custom set of particles and render it. Possibly be able to do interactive things with the image.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            (Main) Be able to make abstract 2D scenes with our custom particles (which differ in parameters such as interaction with light, material modelling, interaction with other particles, etc), and be able to procedurally generate a scene. This gives us the most room for creativity and shows off some topics we learned in this class, such as:
        </p>
        <p>
            - Simulating simplified particle systems
        </p>
        <p>
            - Ray tracing and RT acceleration
        </p>
        <p>
            - Rendering pipeline techniques.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Current Progress: 2 potential routes to accomplish our goal</h1>
       
         <p>
            Threejs: We have a very rudimentary particle model right now, but it could be useful further down the line due to the thorough documentation available.  
        </p>
        <br>
         <p>
            Taichi: Simulation looks great so far as seen in the video, but it could become difficult to understand with more complex particles due to less in depth available documentation.

        <h3>Work Plan (Updated)</h3>
        
            <p>
                Week 1 + 2: Completed: see progress above 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Week 3: Putting together structures, adequate textures, and generating a simulation using our particles on an 8 bit example animation. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Week 4: Rendering more complex and granular animations, like the galaxy sim. 
        </p>
